# insole-3Designer
This project is a fork from [Plycron/orthotic-3D-insoles](https://github.com/Polycron/orthotic-3D-insoles).

A Python program using PyMeshlab for automatically editing 3D Scans of foot imprints. The Output file is meant to be (part of) a 3D printed orthotic insole. Use it for your own research or let it inspire you.
This code uses the [PyMeshlab library](https://pymeshlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that is based on Meshlab, a open source Mesh-editing program.
