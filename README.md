# orthotic-3D-insoles
A Python program using PyMeshlab for automatically editing 3D Scans of foot imprints. The Output file is meant to be (part of) a 3D printed orthotic insole. Use it for your own research or let it inspire you. I used PyMeshlab library that is based on Meshlab, a open source Mesh-editing program. https://pymeshlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
The best out there if you ask me ^^
Consider to visit Meshlab's GitHub aswell, or their website: https://www.meshlab.net/

I have no clue what licences are, what opensource has to do with it and so on, and so on. So please be responsible!
